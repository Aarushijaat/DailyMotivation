Description:-
1.A Python-based console program called the Daily Motivation Quote Generator was created as a component of the Git Bash & GitHub Practical Project for the Version Control Systems course.
2.Git Bash commands, Git version control principles, branching and merging, merge conflict resolution, and GitHub remote repository management are all practically demonstrated in this project.
3.The application shows sporadic inspirational sayings to promote optimism and efficiency. In order to ensure that appropriate version control procedures were followed, the project was developed using several Git branches, including feature, test, bugfix, and experiment.

Commands Used:-

The following Git and system commands were used throughout the project:

1.Repository Setup
git merge feature
git merge test
git merge bugfix
git merge experiment

2.Viewing Commit History
git log
git log --graph --all

3.GitHub Remote Operations
git remote add origin https://github.com/Aarushijaat/DailyMotivation/branches
git push -u origin master
git push origin branch-name
git pull
